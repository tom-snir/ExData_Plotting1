## Exploratory Data Analysis - Week 1 Assigment

In order to complete this assignment, I've used the following data: 

<a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

I created 4 R scripts, each aimed to create one of the 4 plots required for this assigment. 
In order for the scripts to run properly, the above mentioned data file must be placed in the working directory.

Each script will:

1) Load the data and format the date variable  
2) Subset the relevant section of the data  
3) Convert the date variable to the appropriate format  
4) Create the relevant plot  
5) Save the plot to a .png file   

The resulting scripts are also available on this repo.
